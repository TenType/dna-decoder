# DNA Decoder
Your science teacher gave you some very time-consuming DNA decoding homework? Don't worry, let computers do all the hard labor for you.

Simply run [main.py](main.py) using Python and get the results back instantly. There are already some default inputs that come with this repository, but you can change them anytime by editing [inputs.py](inputs.py).

## I want the answers
Don't worry! If you're just looking for the default answers for the problems already specified in the input file, you can find them in [output.txt](output.txt), no questions asked.

## Example
| Stage              | Code                              |
